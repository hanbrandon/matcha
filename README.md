# matcha
Matcha is Tinder-like web application which allows users to register, view other user's profile, like/dislike users, and even get to chat them if that user likes back.

Since this project is 42 Silicon Valley School project, we had to follow instructions given by the school.
Please check the subject from here : 

Matcha is our third web project. Front-end was done by HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery and EJS.
Back-end was done by Node.js, and we used MySQL for the database.

Socket.io was used to implement the chat and push notification system.
